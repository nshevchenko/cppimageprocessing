Implementation of algorithm on the base of a given template.

- loads and displays an image, pixel value rescaling and shifting 
- performs a convolution on the image for
	- smoothing the image 
	- edge detection in the image
- performs order statistic filtering
- performs point processing
- Thresholding
- Histogram equalisation
- Enhance the program to be able to select an Region of Interest (ROI). Perform the image processing function on the ROI.

- Enhance the program with a menu system. Be able to perform a combination of image processing functions on the ROI. Include an "undo" function



__________ ROI ________________

1)To use ROI right click on an area, drag it at left bottom and release. 
2)Mouse down with mouse up create an imaginary square that now is an ROI.
3)Apply any effects on that desired area.
4)To remove an ROI, right click on the picture. Do step 1 again.
